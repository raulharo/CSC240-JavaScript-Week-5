In this project, you will create an online practice quiz for an Algebra I class. All questions must be answered within a specified time limit. A countdown clock will show the number of seconds remaining to complete the quiz. At the end of the quiz, the number of correct answers will be totaled, and incorrect answers will be marked in red so that you can retake the quiz to correct your mistakes. When the clock is not running, the quiz should be hidden from you.
